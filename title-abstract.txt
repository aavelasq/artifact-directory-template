Title:
The Effect of Twitter Cancel Culture on the Music Industry

Abstract:
Musicians often trend on social media for various reasons but in recent years, there has been a rise in musicians being “canceled” for committing offensive or socially unacceptable behavior. Due to the wide accessibility of social media, the masses are able to hold accountable musicians for their actions through “cancel culture”, a form of modern ostracism. Twitter has become a well-known platform for “cancel culture” as users can easily spread hashtags and see what’s trending, which also has the potential to facilitate the spread of toxicity. We analyze how public sentiment towards canceled musicians on Twitter changes in respect to the type of issue they were canceled for, their background, and the strength of their parasocial relationship with their fans. Through our research, we aim to determine whether cancel culture on Twitter could lead to an increase in toxicity towards a canceled individual.
